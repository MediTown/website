NW.js 0.20.1 is here with Chromium 56 stable update and Node.js v7.5.0. It added [a command line switch](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/nw20/References/Command%20Line%20Options/#-disable-crash-handlertrue) to fix single process mode under windows.

Chromium 56 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like CSS position: sticky and Web Bluetooth. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/12/chrome-56-beta-not-secure-warning-web.html) for more information. NW20 also features [V8 5.6, which delivers a number of key improvements in memory and performance footprint, as well as Ignition and TurboFan pipeline for ES.next](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/12/v8-release-56.html). This version is going to ship the WebAssembly browser preview, which is a new runtime and compilation target for the web. Please refer to the [dedicated upstream blog post](http://v8project.blogspot.de/2016/10/webassembly-browser-preview.html) for further information.

Chromium 56 introduces an optimization to save CPU when tabs are in the background. It's done by [throttling background tabs' timers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vCUeGfr2xzZ67SFt2yZjNeaIcXGp2Td6KHN7bI02ySo/edit). See [this blog post](http://blog.strml.net/2017/01/chrome-56-now-aggressively-throttles.html) for more information. If you don't want this in your NW.js application, you can use the [--disable-raf-throttling switch](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/Command%20Line%20Options/#-disable-raf-throttling) to disable it.

We've made the 0.20 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 56. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
