NW.js 0.19.5 is released with 2 new features: Node.js Support in WebView; Accessing DOM from VM context of Node.

To enable Node.js support in WebView, add the allownw attribute to the webview tag. Then Node.js will be turned on, no matter it loads local file or remote site. Use this feature with caution because webview is normally supposed to load untrusted contents.

Now you can access DOM from VM context of Node. In other words, the following code should work now. Previously it just crash:

```js
var vm = require('vm');
var c = new vm.createContext({e: document.body});
var script = new vm.Script('e.style');
script.runInContext(c);
```

NW19 features Chromium 55, which contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like input handling improvements. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/10/chrome-55-beta-input-handling.html) for more information. NW19 also features [V8 5.5, which ships support for JavaScript's async/await & has 35% less memory consumption on low-memory devices](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/10/v8-release-55.html).
