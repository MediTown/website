We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.18.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 54 beta contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. See the [upstream announcement](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-chrome-team-is-excited-to-announce.html) for more information. NW18 also features V8 5.4, which has some [exciting improvements](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/09/v8-release-54.html) on performance and memory consumption.

We've made the 0.18 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 54. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
