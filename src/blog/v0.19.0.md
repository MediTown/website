We're pleased to release NW.js 0.19.0 with today's Chromium 55 stable upgrade.

Chromium 55 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like input handling improvements. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/10/chrome-55-beta-input-handling.html) for more information. NW19 also features [V8 5.5, which ships support for JavaScript's async/await & has 35% less memory consumption on low-memory devices](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/10/v8-release-55.html).

There are many [security fixes](https://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2016/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) in this release, e.g:
* High CVE-2016-9651: Private property access in V8.
* High CVE-2016-5208: Universal XSS in Blink.
* High CVE-2016-5207: Universal XSS in Blink.

We've made the 0.19 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 55. Thanks to the beta testers for their valuable feedback.
