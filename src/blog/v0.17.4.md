0.17.4 is here with Node.js v6.6.0, as well as bug fixes for the dom storage quota and remote page window handling.

Following our release plan in 2016, we have released new major versions as soon as new Chromium stable release within 1 day. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](https://nwjs.io/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
