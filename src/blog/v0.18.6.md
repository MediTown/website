NW.js 0.18.6 is here with Chromium 54 security update, Node.js v7.1.0 and bug fixes:
High CVE-2016-5199: Heap corruption in FFmpeg.
High CVE-2016-5200: Out of bounds memory access in V8.

Chromium is updated to 54.0.2840.99 for Windows, 54.0.2840.98 for Mac, and 54.0.2840.100 on Linux. We use the same version 54.0.2840.99 for all the 3 platforms after reviewing the changes between them.

The documentation is updated to introduce how to use NPM to install native modules: https://nwjs.io/blog/install-native-modules-with-npm/

Following our release plan in 2016, we release new versions as soon as Chromium stable is updated.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
