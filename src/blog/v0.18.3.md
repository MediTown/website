NW.js 0.18.3 is here with new Node.js v7.0.0, which is the only change in this version.

There are notable changes in the Node major update, please see [the announcement](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v7.0.0/). We've been testing NW 0.18 with Node.js 7.0 prereleases internally for a while. Hopefully this will be a smooth transition for your code. Please file issues if you find anything wrong.
