0.21.3 is released with Chromium 57 stable update happened earlier today, shortly after our previous release.

We've made the 0.21 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 57. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback.
Chromium 57 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like CSS Grid Layout and [WebAssembly support](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5453022515691520). See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/02/chrome-57-beta-css-grid-layout-improved.html) for more information.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support. For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
