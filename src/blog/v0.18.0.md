We are happy to release NW.js 0.18.0 with today's Chromium stable 54. Node.js is updated to v6.8.0. It also contains bug fixes since 0.17.6.

Chromium 54 contains important security updates, under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and cool new features like Custom Elements V1, BroadcastChannel, and WebUSB API to explore. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/09/chrome-54-beta-custom-elements-v1.html) for more information. NW18 also features V8 5.4, which has some [exciting improvements](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/09/v8-release-54.html) on performance and memory consumption.

As Node.js v7.0 will be released soon, we'll upgrade to it in 0.18.x later.

We've made the 0.18 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 54. Thanks to the beta testers for their valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
