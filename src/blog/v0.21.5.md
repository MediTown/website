title: NW.js v0.21.5 with Crash Dump Uploading

# {{{title}}}

0.21.5 is released with a new feature: crash dump uploading. Once the app crashed, the crash dump file and information about the runtime environment will be sent to the crash server specified in the manifest with a URL. See the [documentation](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/Manifest%20Format/#crash_report_url) for more information. We don't provide an API to specify the URL because the crash handler need to be launched as early as it can to cover the code runs earlier than the application.

Spell checking for windows is fixed in this release.
