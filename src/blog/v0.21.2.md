0.21.2 adds support for WebView Cookie API, with which you can use [chrome.cookies](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/cookies) API to query and modify cookies in the webview. See [the official documentation](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/webview%20Tag/#cookies-support-in-webview) for detailed example. Thanks to [Jan Rucka](https://github.com/janRucka) from [Seznam.cz](https://www.seznam.cz/) for the contribution of the feature. And it's excited to see they have developed a [full featured browser](https://www.seznam.cz/prohlizec) on top of NW.

Node.js is updated to v7.7.3 in this version. 

This version includes a fix for crash on opening new window; `chrome.runtime.onInstalled` event is fixed so the Signal desktop application could run out-of-the-box.

We've made the 0.21 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 57. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback.
Chromium 57 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like CSS Grid Layout and [WebAssembly support](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5453022515691520). See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/02/chrome-57-beta-css-grid-layout-improved.html) for more information.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support. For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
