We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.19.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 55 beta contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like input handling improvements. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/10/chrome-55-beta-input-handling.html) for more information. NW19 also features [V8 5.5, which ships support for JavaScript's async/await & has 35% less memory consumption on low-memory devices](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/10/v8-release-55.html).

We've made the 0.19 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 55. Please try it and give your valuable feedback.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
