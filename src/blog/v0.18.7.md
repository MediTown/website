NW.js 0.18.7 is here with bug fixes for OSX regressions. This should be the last release in 0.18 branch because 0.19.0 is expected soon with Chromium 55.

The documentation is updated to clarify a common misunderstanding that NW requires you to use HTML as the only entrance of the program. Please see the ChangeLog for more information.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
