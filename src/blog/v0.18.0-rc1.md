NW.js 0.18.0-rc1 in beta branch is here with the latest Chromium Beta 54 update and all the changess we released in stable branch (0.17.4).

Chromium 54 beta contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and cool new features like Custom Elements V1, BroadcastChannel, and WebUSB API to explore. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/09/chrome-54-beta-custom-elements-v1.html) for more information. NW18 also features V8 5.4, which has some [exciting improvements](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/09/v8-release-54.html) on performance and memory consumption.

We've made the 0.18 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 54. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. As Node.js v7 is scheduled in Oct, which should be later than Chromium 54 stable and NW 0.18.0 release, we'll see the Node v7 update in NW after 0.18.0.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
