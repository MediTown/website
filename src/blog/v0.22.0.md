We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.22.0 with Chromium 58 Stable Upgrade. In the version, the JavaScript Source Code Protection feature is vastly improved by elimating the performance overhead. See [the blog post](https://nwjs.io/blog/js-src-protect-perf/) for more information.

Chromium 58 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like IndexedDB 2.0 and an improvement to iframe navigation. See the [upstream announcement](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/nic58) for more information.

We've made the 0.22 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 58. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
