0.21.6 is released with Node.js v7.9.0 and an important bug fix on command line argument handling.

The command line argument is passed to the application correctly now if it's a file path. Note that there is a limitation for now: if the command line argument is the filename of .js file on disk, NW will just run it as upstream Node.js. This is for supporting child_process.fork() API.

## ChangeLog

- Update Node.js to [v7.9.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v7.9.0/)
- Fix: Unable to open a file as argument with an NWjs app [(#5242)](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5242)
- [docs] command line argument handling
