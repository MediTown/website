We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.24.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 60 beta features Paint Timing API, CSS font-display, and Credential Management API improvements. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html) for more information.

There is [a bug in the 0.23](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5964) stable branch that it will crash if 0.24 version has ran and upgraded the user data dir. It's fixed now and will be released with 0.23.3.

We've made the 0.24 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 60. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
