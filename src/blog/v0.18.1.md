NW.js 0.18.1 is here with Node 6.8.1, single process mode support and bug fixes.

Under the single process mode, NW is running with only one process in the system. It can be turned on with switch `--single-process`.

As Node.js v7.0 will be released soon, we'll upgrade to it in 0.18.x later.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
