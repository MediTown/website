We're excited to announce NW.js 0.25.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 61 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. Please check upstream information [here](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone%3D61) and [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/).

We've made the 0.25 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 61. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
