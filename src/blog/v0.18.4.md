We are happy to announce NW.js 0.18.4 with Node.js working in Web Workers.

To enable this feature, use command line argument `--enable-node-worker`. One of the best things about it is that you can offload CPU hogging tasks with new threads, while [exchange large amount of data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage) with DOM efficiently with the [structured clone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) algorithm.

Starting from day 1 of our mission, we want to provide JavaScript programmers capabilities of writing native applications as C/C++ programmers can do. Besides the [source code protection feature](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Advanced/Protect%20JavaScript%20Source%20Code/), writing multi-threaded applications is one of them, to utilize modern multi-core CPUs and keep your application responsive. Read the [guide on Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) and you can just use Node within it.

Please note that binary modules of Node.js need to be thread-safe to be used in this way. We've made modifications to Node.js core to make sure core APIs are thread-safe, while we can not promise this with 3rd party binary modules. Pure JS modules are thread safe as long as they depends on thread-safe modules only. And there shouldn't be any side effect when the feature is not turned on.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
