title: NW.js v0.14.7 (LTS) Released

# {{{title}}}

In LTS branch, NW.js 0.14.7 is released with all the new features and bug fixes we developed in 0.15 and 0.16. New features are:
* Option of margin with the custom printing API
* App.clearAppCache(manifest_url) for clearing Application Cache
* APIs for read/write multiple types of data to clipboard

NW 0.14.x is the long term supported (LTS) version. Chromium will stay at 50 and Node.js will stay at v5.x in 0.14. The plan is to keep active development on 0.14 for at least 1 year and then keep maintenance for another year. During this period we'll fix issues in the NW part. Backporting Chromium and Node.js fixes will be considered on request. Windows XP and Mac OSX version earlier than 10.9 will be supported in 0.14.

In 2016 our release plan is to bump the major version with Chromium upstream release every 6 weeks. The stable version will keep moving with Chromium 52 in 0.16 and so on.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later version, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
