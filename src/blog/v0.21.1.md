# {{{title}}}

The 0.21.1 fixed an [important issue](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5762) with which wrong user data path is used on Windows.

Earlier today we announce NW.js 0.21.0 with Chromium 57 stable upgrade and Node.js v7.7.2.

Chromium 57 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like CSS Grid Layout and [WebAssembly support](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5453022515691520). See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/02/chrome-57-beta-css-grid-layout-improved.html) for more information.

0.21.0 includes 2 important bug fixes for:

* Program hang or crash after printing (or other few synchronized operations)
* Microtasks in Blink are called in different cycles with Chromium

We've made the 0.21 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 57. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
