We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.24.0 with Chromium 60 upgrade and Node.js 8.2.1.

Chromium 60 features Paint Timing API, CSS font-display, and Credential Management API improvements. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html) for more information. The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.24 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 60. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
