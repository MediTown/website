We're pleased to announce NW.js 0.23.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 59 beta features Headless Chromium and Native notifications on macOS. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/05/chrome-59-beta-headless-chromium-native.html) for more information.

In this version, we deliever the same thing as upstream headless browser to support [the usage in upstream](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome), and we'll continue [our plan for this](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/769#issuecomment-294064358). In the meantime, we're still [collecting users requirements](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/769#issuecomment-259867271). Please join the discussion if you have anything needed beyond the upstream usage scenario.

0.23 also delivers huge improvements in the JavaScript Source Protection feature by default, see our [previous blog post](https://nwjs.io/blog/js-src-protect-perf/) on this.

We've made the 0.23 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 59. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
