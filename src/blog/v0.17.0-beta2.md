NW.js 0.17.0-beta2 is released in Beta branch with latest Chromium beta 53.0.2785.70. Node.js is updated to the latest stable 6.4.0.

Chromium 53 beta contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2016/08/chrome-53-beta-shadow-dom.html) for more information. NW17 also features V8 5.3, which has some [exciting improvements](http://v8project.blogspot.com/2016/07/v8-release-53.html) on performance and memory consumption.

We've made the 0.17 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 53. Please try it and give your valuable feedback as there is significant internal changes on the build system in this version.

We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a LTS branch which will be supported for the next 2 years.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
