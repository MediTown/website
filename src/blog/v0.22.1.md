NW.js 0.22.1 is here with Chromium 58 update. Since the patents on [MP3 decoding are expired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3#Licensing.2C_ownership_and_legislation) in the last month, NW.js enables the mp3 decoding support in this version.

Chromium 58 contains under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore like IndexedDB 2.0 and an improvement to iframe navigation. See the [upstream announcement](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/nic58) for more information. We've made the 0.22 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 58. And we've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
